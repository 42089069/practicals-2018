    "The data is provided as a CSV file.  There are a small number of cases where no value is available, these are indicated in the data with `?`. I have used the `na_values` keyword for `read_csv` to have these interpreted as `NaN` (Not a Number).  Your first task is to decide what to do with these rows. You could just drop these rows or you could [impute them from the other data](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#imputation-of-missing-values).\n",
